**Incognito IDPS âš¡**

Advanced Intrusion Detection and Prevention System for Host Security

Silent Thunder IDPS is a powerful Host-Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (HIDS) designed to monitor, detect, and prevent unauthorized activities on a system. It combines real-time file system monitoring, network surveillance, and process tracking with an AI-powered anomaly detection engine to identify potential threats before they escalate.

**ðŸ”¥ Key Features**

**âœ… Real-Time File System Monitoring** â€“ Detects file creation, modification, deletion, and movement in protected directories.

**âœ… Network Activity Tracking** â€“ Monitors incoming and outgoing network connections for suspicious behavior.

**âœ… Process Monitoring** â€“ Detects unauthorized or unusual system processes.

**âœ… AI-Powered Anomaly Detection** â€“ Uses Machine Learning (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify unusual activity patterns.

**âœ… Customizable Alert System** â€“ Sends real-time notifications via email, Telegram, or desktop alerts.

**âœ… Automated Threat Response** â€“ Can block malicious processes or network activity based on detection rules.

**âœ… Lightweight and Efficien** â€“ Optimized for minimal system impact while maintaining high security.
